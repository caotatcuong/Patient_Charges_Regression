# Patient_Charges_Regression
## Overview
Dataset contains individual medical cost information.

In this project, we analyze the main factors that affect medical costs and and predict it based on those factors.
## Machine learning models used:
Linear models: Linear regression, Ridge regression, Polynominal.

Ensemble models: Random Forests, AdaBoost, XGBoost,Gradient Boost, LGBM, Stacking.

MLP regressor, SVM.
## Result
With Random Forests, error on train set is RMSE = 4456 and test set is RMSE = 4495.
